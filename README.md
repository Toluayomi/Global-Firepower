# Global-Firepower 2022
----------------------------------------------
# Introduction

The Global Firepower provides an annual defense review among the nations of the Wolrd. 
Each country is evaluated using multiple categories (Man power, Equipments, Natural Resources, Logistics, Geography etc) to determine it's Power Index Score. 
The smaller the Power Index Vlaue is, the more powerful a nation's theoretical fighting capacity is (by conventional means, nuclear weapon capacity is not taken into account).
A perfect power index score is 0.0000 which is realistically unattainable in the scope of the current Global Firepower (GFP) formula

# Data Source

Data set was provided in a csv file format by the D'Challenger (a non-profit organization) created towards advancement of data analysis skills for it's May 2022 challenge edition.

# Data Transformation and Cleaning

Data was thereafter imported into the Power query editor of power BI tool for cleaning, analysing and visualization. It contains 2 sheets mainly
1. Matadata shet that has the information about the data and,
2. Global fire ranking 2022 sheet which has the following columns: 
•country •country_code •PowerIndex •Continent •Active Personnel •Aircraft Carriers
•Armored Vehicles •Attack Helicopters •Available Manpower •Coastline Coverage
•Corvettes •Dedicated Attack •Defense Budget($)	•Destroyers •External Debt •Fighters/Interceptors	
•Fit-for-Service •Foreign Exchange/Gold	•Frigates •Helicopter Carriers •Helicopters	
•Labor Force •Merchant Marine Fleet •Mine Warfare •Navy Ships •Oil Consumption •Oil Production	
•Oil Proven Reserves •Paramilitary •Patrol Vessels •Ports / Trade Terminals •Purchasing Power Parity •Railway Coverage •Reaching Mil Age Annually	
•Reserve Personnel •Roadway Coverage •Rocket Projectors	 •Self-Propelled Artillery •Shared Borders •Special-Mission	
•Square Land Area •Submarines •Tanker •Fleet Tanks •Total Aircraft Strength,	Total Population •Towed Artillery •Trainers •Transports	•Waterways (usable)
